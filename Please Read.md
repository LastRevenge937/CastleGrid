# Hello!
This is my first big repository. I'm going to go into something that might be buggy that I included in CastleGrid.
First thing I'd like to address is the grid design I came up with. This system was originally a proof of concept, and as an 8th grader, this is pretty damn big of a project. I made this system compatible with other users so you can share the link with your friends, and you **SHOULD** be able to connect to the same network.
If there are any bugs or glitches with the multi-person connection, please tell me, and I'll do my best to fix them. I will be designing and including a firewall in this Repo in case people don't want to go through the hassle of making their own, which I get. 
This was a **STUPIDLY** fun project to make. If you have any suggestions or ideas for things to add on. I will read them and try to include them.

# Hello!
This is my first big repository. I'm going to go further into detail about the things CastleGrid can do in this document.
First thing I'd like to address is the system I made. This system was originally a proof of concept, and as an 8th grader, this is pretty damn big of a project. I made this system compatible with other users, so you can give your friends the link, and you **SHOULD** be able to connect to the same network.
If there are any bugs or glitches with the multi-person design, please tell me, and I'll do my best to fix them. I will be designing and including a firewall in this Repo in case people don't want to go through the hassle of making their own, which I get. 
This was a **Stupidly** fun project to make. If you have any suggestions or ideas for things to add on. I will read them and try to include them.

# CASTLE GRID — IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT (v1.0)
Think of this as a stacked system, not magic.
 Each Layer = a trust zone
 Each Cell = a service / process / container / script

 **LAYER 0 — LIMBO (ENTRY / PERIMETER)**
Purpose: Nothing gets inside without passing here
 Security: INSANE (highest active defense)
Cells on Layer 0

* Moat Cell
* Network scanning
* Connection filtering
* Honeypot exposure
* Gate Cell
* GFID assignment
* Passport-style checks
* Sentinel Guard HQ
* Controls access to every other cell
* Firewall (Double-Layered)
* Outer + inner firewall logic
* Portcullis Cell (AI Ports)
* Opens/closes ports dynamically
* Checkpoint Cell
* Metadata scan
* Encryption detection
* Network Honeypot Cell
* Basic Dockyard Cell
* Non-critical file intake
* Basic Library Cell
* Non-sensitive files
* Audit Log Cell
* Append-only logs

**Rules**
No GFID → file frozen → Layer 7 (Arena)
***Everything logged***
Nothing bypasses Gate + Sentinel

 **LAYER 1 — COURTYARD (NORMAL USE)**
Purpose: Everyday operations
 Security: Very High
Cells on Layer 1
* Courtyard Cell
* General Library Cell
* File Honeypot Cell
* Low-Risk Workflow Cell
* Patrol Cell
* Internal Comms Cell
Think: where your normal files live after they’re trusted.

 **LAYER 2 — INFRASTRUCTURE (SYSTEM CONTROL)**
Purpose: Hardware & resources
 Security: Very High
Cells on Layer 2
* CPU Monitor Cell
* GPU Monitor Cell
* RAM Monitor Cell
* Storage Tracker Cell

* Scheduling Cell
* Telemetry / Metrics Cell


 **LAYER 3 — OPERATIONS (PROCESS FLOW)**
Purpose: How things run
 Security: High
Cells on Layer 3
* Workflow Cell
* Batch Transfer Cell
* Update Staging Cell
* Process Organizer Cell
* Agent Coordination Cell
This is your “pipeline logic”.
 
 **LAYER 4 — SECURED TRANSIT (ESCORT ZONE)**
Purpose: Moving important files safely
 Security: Very High
 Cells on Layer 4
* Escort Corridor Cell
* Secured Transit Cell
* Locking Cell
* Elevator Cell (3 checks)
* Encryption Cell
* Files get encrypted here before vaulting or shipping
Only escorted files are allowed here.

**LAYER 5 — INTER-CASTLE EXCHANGE (PIER)**
Purpose: Sharing with friends’ Castles
 Security: EXTREME
Cells on Layer 5
* Pier Cell
* Treaty Enforcement Cell
* Reputation Ledger Cell
* Foreign Intake Cell
* Encrypted Convoy Controller
* Escort Command Cell
* Bullet-Route Transit Cell
Disabled entirely during Purge
  Copy-only doctrines, never originals

**LAYER 6 — QUARANTINE CITY**

* Quarantine City Cell
* Deep Inspection Cell
* Customs / Inspection Cell
* Metadata Forensics Cell
* File Honeypot Cell
* Temporary Containment Vault
No outbound routes except to Arena

**LAYER 7 — ARENA (SHADOW GRID TEST RANGE)**

 Security: ABSOLUTE ISOLATION
Cells on Layer 7
* Arena Cell
* Recon Cell
* Vulnerability Scan Cell
* Exploit Simulation Cell
* Auth & Crypto Test Cell
* Forensics & Trace Cell
* Honeypot Analysis Cell
* Arena Findings Log Cell (append-only text file)
VM-only, snapshot reset every run
No outbound connections

 **LAYER 8 — CROWN VAULTS**
Purpose: Most important data
 Security: MAXIMUM
Cells on Layer 8
* Crown Vault Cell
* Elevator Cell (5 checks)
Everything here is encrypted + escorted

 **LAYER 9 — RINZLER FACTORY**
Purpose: Emergency containment
 Security: LOCKED
Cells on Layer 9
* Rinzler Factory Cell
* Containment Command Cell
* Rinzler Barracks Cell
Only active during Purge
Defensive only, no retaliation

 **LAYER 10 — PRIVATE SHADOW GRID**
Purpose: Intelligence & evolution
 Security: ABSOLUTE
Cells on Layer 10
* Private Shadow Grid Core
* Doctrine Engine Cell
* Agent Genetics & Promotion Cell
* Shadow Grid Storage Cell
